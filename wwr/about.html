              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>While Peru may be better known for its Inca ruins and food, the white water rafting here is some of the best in the world- particularly the rafting in Cusco. All the rain that falls on the high mountains of the Andes has to escape somewhere. And you can join it on its journey to either the Atlantic Ocean to the East or to the Pacific to the West, depending on which river you raft. The Andes mountains were formed as a result of uplift. While their origins lie in the collision of two tectonic plates around 170 million years ago, the uplift that raised the mountains we see today started 25 million years ago. Glaciers then formed valleys. The meltwater from these glaciers, ran through these valleys, grinding out the canyons in which most white water rafting in Peru takes place today.</p>
